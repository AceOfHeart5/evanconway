            <p>
                I'm a programmer and composer based in Brooklyn NY. Whether it's a new library, an interesting VST, or game, I love learning new things. I spent 10 years in the music industry as a piano teacher and composer. And I've spent about 1.5 years programming professionally.  I value clean, readable code, and seeing a project done well.
