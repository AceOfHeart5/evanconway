### About Me

I'm a programmer and composer based in Brooklyn NY. Whether it's a new library, an interesting VST, or game, I love learning new things. I spent 10 years in the music industry as a piano teacher and composer. And I've spent about 1.5 years programming professionally.  I value clean, readable code, and seeing a project done well. 

If you'd like to know more check out my demo projects linked above!

I'm currently job searching. If you're interested in contacting me, please reach out. I'd love to hear from you!
