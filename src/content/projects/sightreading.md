Finding good material to practice sight-reading is difficult. The music can't be too hard or easy, and you need a lot of music to read through in order to make any real improvement. In the past I've used typing test programs to improve my typing speed, so I thought I'd make something similar, but for sight reading. The app randomly generates sheet music according to options set by the user. When run in a supported browser (just Google Chrome right now), the app can detect MIDI input from an electric piano. The green-highlighted note cursor only advances once the correct notes have been played.
