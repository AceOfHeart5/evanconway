My goal in creating this game was to uncover all the unexpected challenges involved in making a complete game. The content of this game is minimal, but it does have most of the features anyone would expect from a modern indie game:
- sprites with animations
- attacking and blocking mechanics
- hitstun
- keyboard and controller support
- rebindable controls
- sound effects
- music
- options menu for changing settings
- cutscenes
- character interactions
- text boxes with typing effects
