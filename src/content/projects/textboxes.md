A key part of any video game is text boxes. When I'm working on a project, I often find myself wanting to draw text with a single word highlighted a different color or maybe floating in place. This isn't that hard to do, but it's cumbersome to have to do it over again for each project. I also wanted to display text that could type out still have added special effects. So I made a special collection of classes and functions to give text interesting effects.
