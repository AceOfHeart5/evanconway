I was working on this website [gamesheadtohead.com](https://gamesheadtohead.com). It gives you 2 games and you get to pick your favorite between them. While building the features I ran into some pretty fun combinations, like [Lego Racers](https://www.igdb.com/games/lego-racers) vs [Oblivion](https://www.igdb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion). And I'd share these combos with my friends by taking a screen shot and posting it to discord.

But I quickly realized that A: that process is annoying and B: it'd very cool if there was some way to make sharing a battle a feature of the website.
